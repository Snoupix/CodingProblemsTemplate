# [Typescript] Coding Problems Template
This is a template that can be used for any problems website ([hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com), [leetcode](https://leetcode.com), etc).

To transpile and run, you need to have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and Typescript installed globally (`npm install -g typescript` => [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)) then run these 2 commands:
- `tsc -p .\tsconfig.json`
- `node build/runner.js`

For example, in powershell, you can do it in one line:
- `tsc -p .\tsconfig.json; node build/runner.js`
